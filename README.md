### Hello, I'm Luke. Welcome to my GitHub 👋

After 10 years of international English teaching, I'm now pursuing a love of coding and design. I trained at Northcoders and build a portfolio demonstrating skills in both front and back‐end technologies. I'd love to continue exploring web accessibility and UX design. My skills include JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Python and Flutter.
