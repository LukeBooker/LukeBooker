### Hello, I'm Luke. Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

After 10+ years of international English teaching, I'm now pursuing a love of coding and design. I self-taught the fundamentals in Python before focusing on JavaScript and starting the full time developer course at Northcoders. The course enabled me to build a portfolio demonstrating skills in both front end and back end technologies. I enjoy collaborating with others, exploring UI/UX design and web accessibility. My skills include JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Python and Flutter.
