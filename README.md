### Hello, I'm Luke. Welcome to my GitHub üëã

After 10 years of international English teaching, I'm now pursuing a love of coding and design. I trained at Northcoders and build a portfolio demonstrating skills in both front and back‚Äêend technologies. I enjoy collaborating with others on projects whilst exploring web accessibility and UX design. My skills include JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Python and Flutter.
